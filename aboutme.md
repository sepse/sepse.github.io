I'm a Computer Engineer, and here you will find a collection of my projects where I use various technological tools to explore the world and get things done.
I play well with open source software and hardware, with a history of developing prototypes with hardware and software.

### Tech I use:

OS: Linux
Data Science: Python, R
Databases: NoSQL, MySQL, SQLite
IoT: Arduino, ESP8266/32, Raspberry Pi, LoRa; C/C++, YAML
Creative Coding & Web: HTML, JavaScript


### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
